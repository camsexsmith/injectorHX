This repo consists of a finite difference heat transfer method as well as a method utilizing the Heisler charts to calculate heat transfer through a flat plate.

Heisler Method
The python file named heisler.py consists of a crude calculator for utilizing the Heisler charts. However, this relies on user inputted data from the charts and simply outputs a nondimensional temperature. This should not be trusted with mutch accuracy and is decreciated.

Finite Difference Method
The file named finiteDifference.py consists of a one dimensional unsteady finite difference method.
